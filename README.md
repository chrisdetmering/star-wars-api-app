## Summary

This app was written leveraging React, Bootstrap, and Axios. The focus of this project was to build a Star Wars character search that used data from an API and limited results-per-page (pagination).

Features:

- Responsive Design
- Full or partial search parameters

In the future versions I'd like to:

- Expand search beyond character names
- Add Sorting
